# Apple Store

Sit down to any demo box in an Apple Retail Store (or any
Leopard system) and have Git, RubyGems 1.3.1 and SQLite3
working for you in less than a minute.

## Features

Uh, you can work on somebody else's computer.  Oh, and you
don't need root access or XCode installed to set it up.

It doesn't install any files outside of the current
directory.  You can delete the folder you installed it
from and the system will revert to it's previous, boring,
condition.


## Should I fork this and make it install stuff _I_ like?

Yes.
